1.Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict house prices using a Linear Regression model. The dataset contains information about various houses, including their square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and price.

2.Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:

3.Results
The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score. The coefficients and intercept of the Linear Regression model are also displayed.

4.Contributing
